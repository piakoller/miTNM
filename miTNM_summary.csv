"Patient ID: P001
Age: 67
Sex: Male

Clinical summary:
CT shows a 3.1 cm mass in the right upper lobe. No enlarged or FDG-avid mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes. No distant metastases on PET/CT. Biopsy confirms adenocarcinoma.

Impression:
Primary lung mass ~3.1 cm. No nodal involvement. No distant metastasis detected.
","{""miTNM_signature"": {""miT"": ""miT1"", ""miN"": ""miN0"", ""miM"": ""miM0""}, ""confidence"": 0.8, ""rationale"": ""The report describes a 3.1 cm lung mass, classified as miT1, and no nodal or distant metastasis, indicating miN0 and miM0 respectively. The absence of FDG-avid nodes further supports this assessment.""}"
"Patient ID: P002
Age: 59
Sex: Female

Clinical summary:
A 3.5 cm left upper lobe lesion with FDG-avid ipsilateral hilar lymph node measuring 1.2 cm. No evidence of distant metastasis. Pathology consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.

Impression:
Primary tumor ~3.5 cm with ipsilateral nodal involvement; no distant metastases seen.

There is no mention of distant metastasis, therefore miM0 is appropriate.""}"
"Patient ID: P003
Age: 72
Sex: Male

Clinical summary:
A 6.2 cm right lower lobe mass invading the chest wall. No enlarged mediastinal nodes identified. Multiple hepatic lesions consistent with metastases.

Impression:
Large primary tumor (>5 cm) with chest wall invasion, no nodal disease, and distant liver metastases.

Age: 64
Sex: Female

Non-specific cough and weight loss. Chest imaging pending. No pathology report available. No staging workup documented.

Impression:
Insufficient information for staging at this time.
